/**
 * Drives SLA transition evaluation: polls for due rows and hands each batch to
 * {@link SlaTransitionApplier}.
 *
 * <p>Holds no transaction of its own. Batches are drained until one comes back short, so a backlog that
 * built up while the service was down is cleared in one cycle rather than one batch per interval, while a
 * steady state costs a single empty fetch query per interval.
 *
 * <p>One loop over one table settles every verdict, {@code MET} included — it arrives as a
 * {@code MET_CONDITION_REACHED} row like any other schedule, so there is no second pass with its own
 * failure mode to reason about.
 *
 * <p>Safe to run on every instance concurrently — the applier's {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED} fetch is
 * what keeps them off each other's rows.
